My goal in this report is to statistically analyse handwritten datasets of the alphabet, a â€“ j, in addition to
three symbols, a smiley face, a sad face and an exclamation mark. I have hand drawn each of these 8 and 10
times, respectively, totalling 140 images. To analyse these and be able to identify differences and similarities
between this dataset, I will be using hypothesis testing in addition to graphs and tables to illustrate my
findings.
